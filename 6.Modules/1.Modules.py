#  Modules are the python files that I can reuse at the times when needed in the main program.

#  eg: if I create a math_tools.py in which I have create functions of operators used in calculations.

#  I can use that python file in some other code let's say main.py

#  the python file can be used fully by just importing using the code below: 
#  import math_tools

#  or a single function can be used by importing a single functions: 
# from math_tools import add


#  there are few built-in modules mentioned below:

# 1. os --> Work with files, folders, paths
# 2. random --> Generate random IDs, OTPs, tokens
# 3. datetime --> Time, Dates, Timestamps
# 4. json --> APIs literally communicate in json
# 5. math --> for math operations
# 6. sys --> things like system paths, args, execution control.
