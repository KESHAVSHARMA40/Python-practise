# What is indexing in Python?
# Indexing means picking out specific value from something that has an order.

# What’s the difference between positive and negative indexing?
# The positive indexing means selecting a specific value from the starting of the string while the negative indexing means selecting a specific value from the last of the sting.

# What happens if you use an index that’s out of range?
# It will display an error message in the terminal.

# How do you get the last element of a list or string using indexing?
# print(A[-1])
