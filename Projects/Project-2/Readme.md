🚀 PROJECT-2: Student Records Manager (Console App)

---

Think of it as a tiny version of a backend system.

---

You'll build everything using:

1. dictionaries

2. nested dictionaries

3. loops

4. list + dict operations

5. simple validation

---

🧠 WHY THIS PROJECT MATTERS

This hits EVERYTHING you struggle with:

nested structures

iterating over dicts

updating values

searching loops

condition checks

real backend-like logic

You're basically writing a small CRUD system — the foundation of 90% of real applications.
