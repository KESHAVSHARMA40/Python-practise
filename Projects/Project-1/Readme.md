🧠Smart Utility Console

A beginner-friendly Python project using conditional statements.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

📘 Overview

The Smart Utility Console is a menu-driven Python program that lets users access multiple small utilities - such as discount calculator, temperature alert, loan eligibility checker and electricity bill generator within one application.

This program is designed to help beginners strengthen their understanding of conditional statements (If, Elif, else) and basic program logic.

🧩 Project Description

You’ll build a console-based app that offers a few mini-utilities.
Each utility solves a real-world problem using conditional logic only — no loops, no functions (yet).
Later, we’ll refactor it with loops and functions when you learn those topics.

⚙️ Core Features

1. Main Menu

    Display a numbered list of available utilities.

    Accept user input to select a feature.

    Invalid input → show an error message.

2. Utility-1: Discount Calculator

    Ask for total purchase amount.

    Apply:

    10% discount if amount > 5,000

    20% if amount > 10,000

    No discount otherwise.

    Print the final price after discount.


3. Utility-3: Loan Eligibility Checker

    Input: age, monthly income, and credit score.

    Eligible if:

    age ≥ 21

    income ≥ 25,000

    credit score ≥ 650

    Print “Eligible” or “Not eligible.”

4. Utility-4: Electricity Bill Calculator

    Input units used.

    Rates:

    Up to 100 units → ₹5/unit

    101–200 units → ₹7/unit

    Above 200 → ₹10/unit

    Add ₹50 fixed charge.

    Print total bill.
