##<h2> 🐍 Python Practice Playground </h2>

Welcome to my **Python Practice Playground** — a structured, evolving collection of Python exercises, logic drills, and mini-projects created to build strong fundamentals for backend development.

This repository reflects my **hands-on learning**, consistent practice, and growing confidence with Python.

---

##<h3> 🎯 Purpose of This Repository </h3>

This repo serves as my personal coding playground where I:

- Strengthen core Python fundamentals  
- Practice real-world problem solving  
- Work with common data structures and algorithms  
- Build CLI-based utilities and beginner-friendly projects  
- Prepare myself for backend development fundamentals  
- Track my progress publicly for recruiters, mentors, and peers  

This is not a polished “portfolio” — it’s where I *practice* before building production-level projects.
